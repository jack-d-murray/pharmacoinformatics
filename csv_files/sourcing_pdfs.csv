The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but mainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease.In patients with high viral load (>100,000 copies/ml) choice of therapy needs special consideration.Overall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to that obtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis).Before initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be performed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin. Screening is also recommended prior to re-initiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir (see 'management after an interruption of Trizivir therapy').

Efficacy has been demonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of first onset of symptoms.Prevention of influenzaPost-exposure prevention in individuals one year of age or older following contact with a clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community.The appropriate use of Tamiflu for prevention of influenza should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection. In exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a pandemic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age or older.Tamiflu is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic-influenza outbreak.Tamiflu is not a substitute for influenza vaccination.The use of antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza should be determined on the basis of official recommendations. Decisions regarding the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxis should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating influenza viruses, available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns for each season and the impact of the disease in different geographical areas and patient populations.",09/08/2018,24/03/2023,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu,['VSZGPKBBMSAYNT-RRFJBIMHSA-N'],https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/tamiflu-epar-product-information_en.pdf
